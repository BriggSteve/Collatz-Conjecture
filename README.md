# Step on up one and all! 
Test your luck in helping solve one of math's oddest phenomena! You too can be regarded as a mathematician by running this recreation of Collatz Conjecture! This handy program will magically cycle through each positive integar indefinitely. 
 

## But what is Collatz Conjecture?
Collatz Conjecture is a system for rendering any positive integar into 1 by following two steps. If the number is even, divide it by 2, if it is odd, mulitply it by 3 and add 1. By preforming these two steps your number will always return to 1 eventually. 


### Can my machine really solve this problem? 

Yes... but probably not. While it is theotrically possible for your machine to find an unproven number, the highest number tested for Collatz Conjecture is well into the billions. But hey, if you leave this on your machine and go on vacation you may come back to something new. Like a fire, or maybe an unproven number, please don't leaving this running in background.
